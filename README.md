# Subex-AI

We participated in Subex AI hackathon, SHAASTRA IITM 2021. This challenge was about information retrieval from invoices. We implemented an object detection and OCR system to detect tables in invoices and extract information from them. Though our system could not match our expectations in information extraction, it achieved an impressive Average Precision of 87.60% in table detection in invoices.
